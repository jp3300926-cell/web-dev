This website is our platform to share what we're learning on the our Journey in IamtheCODE. As four Grade 12 students, we're diving into the world of technology, gaining hands-on training, mentorship, and access to a global network. We're being empowered to code, create, and change the world, and we're excited to share our experiences, building confidence, encouraging new ideas, and inspiring a love for computer programming along the way.

IamtheCODE is a global initiative aiming to empower 1 million young women and girls to code by 2030. They provide tech and digital skills training through programs like hackathons, digital clubs, and mentorships. Partnering with organizations like Coursera and Skillsoft, they focus on achieving the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Operating through four pillars – People, Programs, Processes, and Platform – IamtheCODE has reached over 550,000 women and girls in 88 countries and is celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2025.</p>

~This is all about being able to really dig in and stay with a coding problem until you solve it. It means not letting your phone, your friends, or anything else pull you away from what you're doing.
			</p>
			<p class="text-scroll-animation">
~It also means when you see a really big, scary coding problem, you don't freak out! Instead, you take a deep breath and break it down into smaller, easier steps.
</p>
<p class="text-scroll-animation">
~Another part of this is figuring out what's really important in a coding project and doing those things first. It's like knowing what homework assignment is due tomorrow!
			</p>
			<p class="text-scroll-animation">
~Finally, it means not worrying about making your code super fancy or perfect right away. Just get it working first! You can always make it better later.

	<h2 class="header-scroll-animation">ABSTRACT</h2>
	<img class="journey-img img-scroll-animation" src="focus_and_abstract2.jpg" alt="Image">
	
	<p class="text-scroll-animation">
	~This is about hiding all the complicated, confusing stuff that's going on "under the hood" and showing people a simple, easy-to-use version. Think of it like using your phone – you don't need to know how it really works to send a text.
	</p>
	<p class="text-scroll-animation">
	~It's also about creating little blocks of code that you can use over and over again in different places. It's like having LEGOs – you can use the same brick to build lots of different things.
	</p>
	<p class="text-scroll-animation">
		 ~This involves thinking about the big picture of what you're trying to do, instead of getting lost in all the tiny details.
	</p>
	<p class="text-scroll-animation">
	~It also means using code that other people have already written to solve common problems. Why build a car from scratch when you can just buy one that already works?
