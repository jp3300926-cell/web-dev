				In "Iamthecode," learning JavaScript means making websites interactive. You'll probably struggle with things like making parts of the website update without reloading the whole page. This often involves using tricky things called "Promises" to handle data. You'll also learn to change what's on the page when people click buttons or type things. Sometimes, you might use tools like React or Vue.js, which help organize your code but can be a bit confusing at first because they have their own rules.

				When you use Python in "Iamthecode," you'll often work on the "behind-the-scenes" stuff that makes websites and apps work. You'll learn to organize information, solve problems, and use tools to manage your code. You might also build websites using things like Django or Flask, which help you handle requests from users and talk to databases. Plus, you might use Python to analyze data or build simple AI models, using special tools that help you do math and understand information.

				With CSS in "Iamthecode," you'll learn how to make websites look good. This means figuring out how to arrange things on the page, make the website look good on phones and computers, and choose colors and fonts. You'll need to learn how CSS decides which styles to use when there are conflicts. You'll also learn tricks to make your CSS code easier to manage, and you'll probably have to deal with the fact that different browsers sometimes show things slightly differently.

				In "Iamthecode," learning HTML means building the basic structure of web pages. You'll learn to use special tags to organize your content, like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It's important to make sure your HTML is easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities. You'll also learn how to create forms so people can type in information. Making sure your HTML is correct and follows the rules is a big part of making good websites.
