This website is our platform to share what we're learning on the our Journey in IamtheCODE. As four Grade 12 students, we're diving into the world of technology, gaining hands-on training, mentorship, and access to a global network. We're being empowered to code, create, and change the world, and we're excited to share our experiences, building confidence, encouraging new ideas, and inspiring a love for computer programming along the way.

				At Iamthecode, JavaScript helps you make websites interactive. You'll learn how to update parts of a webpage without reloading the whole thing. This involves using things called "Promises" to handle info. You'll also learn how to change what's on the screen when someone clicks a button or types something. Sometimes, you might use tools that help keep your code organized, but they can be a little tricky to learn at first.

				With Python at Iamthecode, you'll be working on the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes websites and apps run smoothly. You'll learn how to organize info, solve problems, and use tools to keep your code in order. You can even build websites using tools that help you handle requests from users and connect to databases. Plus, you can use Python to analyze data or build simple AI.

			<p class="text-scroll-animation indent">
				CSS at Iamthecode is all about making websites look awesome. You'll figure out how to arrange things on the page, make sure the website looks good on phones and computers, and pick out cool colors and fonts. You'll also need to learn how CSS decides what styles to use when things clash. Plus, you'll learn tricks to keep your CSS code easy to manage. Just a heads up: sometimes different browsers show things a little differently, which can be annoying.

				At Iamthecode, HTML is where you start building the basic structure of web pages. You'll learn to use special tags to organize your content, like headings, paragraphs, and lists. It's super important to make sure your HTML is easy for everyone to use, including people with disabilities. You'll also learn how to create forms so people can type in their info. Making sure your HTML is correct and follows the rules is key to making great websites.
