This website is our platform to share what we're learning on the our Journey in IamtheCODE. As four Grade 12 students, we're diving into the world of technology, gaining hands-on training, mentorship, and access to a global network. We're being empowered to code, create, and change the world, and we're excited to share our experiences, building confidence, encouraging new ideas, and inspiring a love for computer programming along the way.

We're excited to share that we've all completed the courses and tests on Iamthecode! It was a great experience, and we learned a lot from courses like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Python and others.
			</p>
			<p class="text-scroll-animation indent">
We didn't always finish everything super fast, but we really tried our best to understand everything together. Sometimes it was hard to keep up with the time, but we made sure to finish each part and do our best on the tests.
			</p>
			<p class="text-scroll-animation indent">
Because of Iamthecode, we all know a lot more now, and we feel really good about what we've learned. We can't wait to use these skills in future projects and maybe even in our careers. We think this platform really helped us grow, and we're thankful we got to be a part of it!
